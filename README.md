# Fundamental Neural Network Architectures in PyTorch

This repository demonstrates the implementation and training of several foundational deep learning architectures using PyTorch.

## ðŸ“š Architectures Included

### 1. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- Trained on MNIST
- Generator vs Discriminator setup
- Outputs generated image samples after each epoch

### 2. AlexNet
- Classic CNN trained on CIFAR-10
- Shows test accuracy after training

### 3. Autoencoders
- Trained on MNIST
- Visualizes input vs reconstructed images

### 4. AutoDecoders
- Conceptual model for implicit 3D representation
- Dummy dataset used

### 5. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
- Trained using Contrastive Divergence on binarized MNIST
- Shows reconstructed images

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
